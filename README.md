# Clustering_Analysis_on_Credit_Card_Transaction
A credit card company has collected data about its customers, including various features such as balances, purchase behavior, cash advances, credit limits, and more. The company wants to gain meaningful insights from this data and devise strategies to increase credit card sales and revenue

**Objective:**
Develop customer segmentation based on credit card usage patterns.

Identify distinct groups of customers with similar behavior.

Provide recommendations to the company for targeted marketing strategies.

**Data Description:**
The dataset contains information for approximately 9,000 active credit card holders over the last 6 months.

Features include customer ID, balance, purchase frequency, cash advances, credit limit, payments, and more.

Approach:

**Clustering Methods:**
Explore various clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, hierarchical clustering) to group customers based on their similarities.

Evaluate the effectiveness of each method using appropriate metrics (e.g., Davies-Bouldin Index, Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index).

**K-Means Clustering:**
Initialize the K-Means model with a predefined number of clusters (e.g., 4).

Group customers based on their credit card behavior (e.g., purchase frequency, balance, payment patterns).

Refine the centroids iteratively until convergence is achieved.

Provide actionable recommendations to the credit card company:

Tailor marketing campaigns for specific customer groups.
